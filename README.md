# Django-Music-Streaming-Website-DMWS
A music streaming website based on html5,css,javascript and Django.
This is a basic music  streaming website.The playlist and media player is incorporated in the same view in the app home.The app accounts manage the login,logout and registration.Once you run the apporpiate console commands and set up the database you will be able to update the views ie:change song name,artist,duration,album and the song itself from the django admin panel.I use postgre sql as  my database since it's scalable than sqlite.

# Edit 2:
I have changed the website a little bit.The homepage now contains links to songs with pagination.The media palyer pages now contain a commenting system.Rest is the same.
